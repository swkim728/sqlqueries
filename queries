Situation: did recon data but delta was off for gross return.
ran a sql query to sum the pnl across the days of may
***
SELECT sum(pl_total_base)
FROM novus_master.dbo.client_position 
where client_id = 140 and client_portfolio_id = 1193
and datadate between '20200501' and '20200531';
***
returned Novus Gross P%L value exactly.

Hi Joy,
It seems we have received some inaccurate P&l for the month of May. Can you please advise if any of these dates are wrong

Thanks,
Sangwon Kim
